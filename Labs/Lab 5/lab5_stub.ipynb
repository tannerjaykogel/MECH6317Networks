The assortative mixing of this graph makes sense as the countries that have low tariff values would likely get a higher pick of the draw when choosing who to trade with, and they would likely choose other countries with low tariffs to maximise profit, leading to the assortatively mixed graph."

    "The first quadrant of the graph has the least amount of restrictions on nodes and edges that can remain in the graph, so naturally it has the largest number of communities detected, and many of those communities hold a large number of nodes within them. This can be disadventageous as having many communities of large size means there is a higher chance that there are unrelated nodes within the same communitiy. An example of this is the communitity:\n",

    "The second quadrant has a high weight threshold and a low component threshold. This means that many more edges are being eliminated. This also effects the component detection because the weight threshold is applied first, meaning that because many edges are removed, there may be components that decrease such that they are below the component size threshold when it is applied. Due to this there are many less communities detected and the communities that are detected have many fewer nodes. While it should be stated that important information can be left out like smaller communities and many large communties can be split up or incomplete, this quadrant can remove some nodes from communities that aren't strongly related. An example of a community in this quadrant that contains nodes that have very similar meanings is:\n",

    "\n",
    "The third quadrant has a low weight threshold and a high component threshold. As observed before, due to the weight threshold being implimented first, the the high threshold for community size has less of an effect than the high threshold for edge weight. This can be seen in the number of communities detected and the size of those communities, as there are many more communities, and they can be much larger in quadrant three than quadrant two. In comparison to queadrant one, the addition of the high component threshold decreases the number of communities but does not have as siginificant an effect on the size of the communities, specifically the larger communities. An example of this can be seen in the following community that is intact from quadrant one:\n",

    "The fourth quadrant has the most restrictions on nodes and edges that can remain in the graph, so naturally it has the least number of communities, and of those communities they are much smaller than in the other quadrants. This can be seen as an advantage by ridding the graph of the most outliers and show only the strongest connected nodes from the graph, but this can also be seen as a disadvantage as large amounts of useful information is thrown away. An example of this is the following community, that while the two hashtags are very closely related, it would be expected that there would be many more hashtags that would be very similar and co-occur with them often:\n",
